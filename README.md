## 🌱 About Me (Beyond Tech)

When I’m not writing queries or dashboards, you’ll probably find me diving into tech videos, deep thinking about innovation, or zoning out to music while walking. I enjoy gaming, watching sci-fi and comedy, and sometimes just eating and sleeping my weekend away — no shame in that.

Motorsports and WWE fuel my energy, and I love building motor prototypes just for the thrill of making something real. I can talk for hours about finance, automobiles, farming, family, and anything that sparks practical ideas. I don’t follow anyone’s path too closely — I’m more of a self-driven learner building my own.

**I want anyone reading this profile to feel one thing: I’m the analyst they’ve been searching for.**
